# ubuntu-vnfs-24.04LTS



## Getting started

Setup simply requires a machine with Make and Apptainer installed.

VNFS nomenclature is as follows:

    uvnfs-$TAG-$GITVERSION


The TAG is typically the specified target, but it can be overriden by using
the TAG= syntax as seen below:

    $ make TAG=lrc-compute lrc

note: This is especially useful when using other targets.
